### BUS256: Marketing Analytics
### Assignment4: ML_cancer_prediction
The goal of this assignment is to predict whether a tumor is benign or malign.
The classifiers I included are Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Trees, KNN, and Lasso. And I evaluated the predictive performance of each of these methods using confusion matrices and right-to-total ratios.
